# Swipestakes
Swipestakes is an in-development mobile application for iOS built using React Native. The end goal is a mobile application where users are presented with [player props](https://wageringterms.com/definition/player-prop#:~:text=A%20Player%20Prop%20is%20a,a%20set%20number%20of%20statistics.)
and can make picks. Users will compete with their friends and on a global leaderboard in multiple metrics, including streaks and winrate.
The central goal is to provide a way for users to display their sports knowledge, without having to risk wagering money.

## Planned Features
### Leaderboards
Global, friend-based, and country based leaderboards are planned, where users are ranked on multiple different metrics in relation to others.
### Friend List
A friend list where users can add and see thier friends stats is planned. Additionally a way to challenge friends is in the ideation stage.
### Props
Player props will be displayed in a Tinder-esque format, allowing users to take the Over or Under. Props are planned to be shown at random, based on sports a user is interested in. 
Currently, the idea is that they are given a random, limited number of props per week. This could be customized based on selected favorite teams.
### Stats
Users can see thier statistics, and can see how they compare in relation to friends and others.
